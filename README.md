# The Alter Office Machine Task

## Project Overview

**The Alter Office Machine Task** is a real-time chat application built with Node.js and Express.js. This project demonstrates the implementation of real-time communication using Socket.IO, user authentication with JWT, and OTP handling with Redis. MongoDB is used as the database to manage user and chat data.

## Features

- **Real-Time Chat**: Utilizes Socket.IO to enable instant messaging between users.
- **Authentication**: Implemented JWT for secure user authentication.
- **OTP Handling**: Redis is used for managing One-Time Passwords (OTPs) for user verification.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used for storing user and chat data.
